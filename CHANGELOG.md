## 0.4.0 - 2023-10-17

### Added

- Added `Fmu::variables()` method to easily get a reference to the signal map.

### Fixed

- Fixed `undefined symbol: fmi2EnterEventMode` error when loading FMU's that don't
    contain a ModelExchange model.

### Changed

- `FmuInstance` is now generic over a `Borrow<FmuLibrary>` to allow the user to
    managed `FmuLibrary` lifetime using Cell types.
- Refactored XML structs to deserialize directly to Enums.
- Made `FmuInstance::lib` public.

### Removed

## 0.3.0 - 2023-10-17

    C bindings.


## 0.2.0 - 2023-10-10

    on the same library.

## 0.1.1 - 2023-10-09

### Fixed
